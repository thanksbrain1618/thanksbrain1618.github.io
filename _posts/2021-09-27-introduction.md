I am starting this blog to study all things required to make brain conscious immortality.
The final goal is brain-computer interface. Good luck to me.



### Brain

The most incredible and unexplored thing on our planet. How does it work, and how can we operate with it?
**Consciously interact with the brain as with the machine is the main thing to achieve**.


This is the biggest part of what has to be done. It includes plenty of topics: mathematics, biology, physics, chemistry, philosophy and evolution history.
- mathematics, biology, physics and chemistry help to understand the basic behavior of the brain;
- philosophy and evolution history help to think about the brain from different angles.


### Data Science

It is intriguing science. Machine learning is trying to reproduce brain functions, for instance, artificial neural networks â€” 
a computational model based on the structure and functions of human biological neural networks.


Also, it will help me not to die of starvation and work with ideas close to the main goal.


### Global language

**English nowadays**. It is a significant tool. It helps you to be in the right place and be able 
to understand everything you need. The most innovative countries use global language for their researches.


### Blog

This is an important thing for making you think structured, hone your ability to explain your thought 
and improve your English.


### Happiness of loved ones

They have done plenty of things for you. Give them back twice of that.


### Conclusion

Do not get distracted by unimportant things that culture trying to impose on you. 
Focus your brain on your goal, and you will achieve this goal. Success is that passion and persistence,
of really staying the course, staying working on it, and, not letting go. Not giving up.
