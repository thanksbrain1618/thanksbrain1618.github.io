## General tips 
- **Use intervals for learning**. Our consciousness is easy to destruct. Play with numbers to find what suits you the most. (0:30/0:05; 1:00/0:10; 1:30/0:20)
  During the rest do something you enjoy: talking with your friends, drinking some tea, etc;
- **Build a knowledge graph** for learning from basic to advanced knowledge. 
  Your brain will be able to build a complete picture of knowledge since everything is interconnected;
- **Set deadlines**. You should be careful with that. Do not put too much pressure on yourself.
  It is better slowly go forward rather than rush and stop abruptly.
  You can ask someone you trust to help you with controlling and setting deadlines.
- **Surround yourself with people with the same goals and ideas** (Great example: [Einstein's Olympia Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_Academy));
- **Find hobbies** to rest and recover between lessons.
- **Develop 1-6 month curriculum plans**. Do not make long ones, because it will scare you.

## English tips

  If it is not possible, you can change the surrounding language into English: phone/laptop, videos, movies, books etc.;
