HOOK, the main idea of the post. 
The palaces of the mind by Andrey Kurpatov. Short review and thoughts.




## Brain working

### Apps killing our brain power
We started to use all helpful applications and do not need our brain anymore.
But person has to use it even in simple situations to improve it. It will not bring 
benefits immediately but later. When person does sport, they do not experience profit right away.
The same thing happens with a brain. By this little trainings, for instance building 
navigation map from house to work without navigator, brain learns how to build complex objects.
In consequence, person can use this ability for another purpose like solving math task.

### Brain evolution consequences 
Topics:
- The volume of the cerebral cortex directly depends on the number of individuals in the flock.
  That's why socializing is significant for a person.
  More complicated your surrounding, more complicated objects brain can build.
  People are able to have about 150-200 people in their mind.
- Moreover, when one is spacing out, it is 46% of the time, person is thinking about other people 
  (problems, opinions, behaviour, etc).
  There are evolution reasons. People had to socialize using brain to survive in the past.
  This is the time when brain works the most (experiments). 
  But it's like brain's gum with the same things repeating.
  To clear that a bit we can catch and write down our thoughts and analyse them.
- Brain tries to simplify and abstract everything.

  The same things brain uses to label people.
  We use Zodiak's signs, introvert/extrovert, etc. but the devil is in the details.
  People must not use stories and objects their brains have built but facts. Getting older you
  collect more stories and templates for everything. Those templates are used to evaluate new people, 
  events and everything in people life. Even sounds, images, smells are all brain objects.
  After 25 years old we've built all templates and patterns of our behaviour.
  Of course you do not have to deny what makes you you, but the thing you want to change.
  As Einstein said The huge mistake is doing the same things and wait for another results.
- Consciousness problems:
  1) It's not multitasking. You can focus only on one thing at a time. You can easily change focus,
     but you lose in productivity in this case.
  2) There are only three intellectual objects at a time. (calculation example)
  3) The duration of one's thought is three seconds. If the thought is longer,
     the brain glues it together piece by piece.
     
  That's why a person should use consciousness to navigate a lazy but powerful brain.
  Probably you are unique and can control your mind. If so, try not to thing about white monkey for
  20 seconds.
- Working process:
  1) When brain can't find quick template/solution that bothers it.
  2) At that time you are easy to interrupt.
  
## Is it possible to build complex system in your head without society?
Classic Books like Karamazovi brothers by Dostoevsky, Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas etc. 
with complex characters.

Do philosophy books work the same being monologue? 

## Conclusion
You can read more about all this things in the book.
