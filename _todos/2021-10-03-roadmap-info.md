## Practices

### 1. Reduce the search space, make 1-6 month curriculum plans

There’s no shortage of learning resources. Having too many options is the same as having no options.
Set yourself up with a curriculum.

### 2. Fix your environment

Remove all distractions during lessons time. Surround yourself with people with the same goals as yours.
(Great example: [Einstein's Olympia Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_Academy));

### 3. Force yourself to start

4-minutes in, it’s hell. Burning hell. I keep going. 24-minutes in and I don’t want to stop.
The timer goes off and I set another. And then another. After 3 sessions, I solve the problem. 
I tell myself, I’m the best engineer in the world.

### 4. Sometimes do nothing

**Focused thinking** happens when you’re doing a single task.

**Diffused thinking** happens when you’re not thinking about anything.

The best learning happens at the crossover of these two. It’s why you have some of your best thoughts in the shower. Because there’s nothing else happening.
When you let diffused thinking takeover, it gives your brain space to tie together all of the things it absorbed during focused thinking

### 5. Sleep, exercise, health

Poor sleep means poor studying. Don’t trade sleep for more study time. Do the opposite.

### 6. Intervals

Play with numbers to find what suits you the most. (0:30/0:05; 1:00/0:10; 1:30/0:20) During the rest do something you enjoy: talking with your friends, drinking some tea, etc;

### 7. Build knowledge graph

For learning from basic to advanced knowledge. 
Your brain will be able to build a complete picture of knowledge since everything is interconnected;

### 8. Set deadlines

You should be careful with that. Do not put too much pressure on yourself. 
It is better slowly go forward rather than rush and stop abruptly. 
You can ask someone you trust to help you with controlling and setting deadlines.

### 9. Only dumb devices near bed

### 10. Zooming out first, then diving deep

### 11. Spaced repetition

### 12. Verbally stated goals

Clarity of your desires, goals, and vision. 

### 13. Single tasking

Focus is knowing exactly what you want to be, have, and do. Concentration is persevering, without diversion or distraction, 
in a straight line toward accomplishing the things that can make a real difference in your life.

### 14. Deep work blocks based on your body's rhythm

### 15. 80/20s at every level

20 percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results.
Two out of ten items, on any general to-do list, will turn out to be worth more than the other eight items put together.
The sad fact is that most people procrastinate on the top 10 or 20 percent of items that are the most valuable and important,
and busy themselves instead with the least important 80 percent that contribute very little to their success.
Ask yourself: If you could only accomplish one of the goals on that list today, which one goal would have the greatest positive impact on your life?
Then pick the second most important goal. **Eat the biggest frog first**. 
Before you begin work, always ask yourself, “**Is this task in the top 20 percent of my activities** or in the bottom 80 percent?”

## Believes

### 1. Fundamental drive: the joy of learning, maximizing usefulness

Studying fun. Einstein's curiosity, my own curiosity.
Studying is said to be work. With this attitude it will be hell to study. Because there’s always more to learn.
Think about studying as a game. But suppose, you have the idea studying is the process of going 
through one topic and then to the next. Connecting different things like a game. 
You learn one thing, you use it to learn something else, you get stuck, you get over it, you learn another thing. 
And you make a dance out of it.

But on the other side embrace the suck. Studying sucks. You learn one thing and forget it the next day.
After studying something for a year you realise how much more there is to learn.

### 2. Don't go around in circles and don't go blind

The huge mistake is doing the same things and wait for another results.

### 3. Social accountability

### 4. Time * intensity of focus = progress

### 5. Context switching costs

### 6. Goal factoring

### 7. Zero distractions

### 8. Dream big dreams


## Anti-patterns

1. Purely project-based learning
2. Learning styles
3. Digital hoarding
4. 1+ year curriculum plans
5. Willpower
6. Announcing goals (is dangerously satisfying)
