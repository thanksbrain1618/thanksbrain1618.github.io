## Practices

### 1. Reduce the search space, make 1-6 month curriculum plans

There‚Äôs no shortage of learning resources. Having too many options is the same as having no options.
Set yourself up with a curriculum.

### 2. Fix your environment. Enrich it with the right people.

Remove all distractions during lessons time. Surround yourself with people with the same goals as yours.
Study groups can be powerfully effective for learning, but if study sessions turn into socializing occasions, all bets are off.
(Great example: [Einstein's Olympia Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_Academy)).

### 3. Force yourself to start

4-minutes in, it‚Äôs hell. Burning hell. I keep going. 24-minutes in and I don‚Äôt want to stop.
The timer goes off and I set another. And then another. After 3 sessions, I solve the problem. 
I tell myself, I‚Äôm the best engineer in the world.

### 4. Sometimes do nothing

**Focused thinking** happens when you‚Äôre doing a single task.

**Diffused thinking** happens when you‚Äôre not thinking about anything.

The best learning happens at the crossover of these two. It‚Äôs why you have some of your best thoughts in the shower. Because there‚Äôs nothing else happening.
When you let diffused thinking takeover, it gives your brain space to tie together all of the things it absorbed during focused thinking

### 5. Sleep, exercise, health

Poor sleep means poor studying. Don‚Äôt trade sleep for more study time. Do the opposite.

### 6. Intervals

Play with numbers to find what suits you the most. (0:30/0:05; 1:00/0:10; 1:30/0:20) During the rest do something you enjoy: talking with your friends, drinking some tea, etc;

### 7. Build knowledge graph. Zooming out first, then diving deep

For learning from basic to advanced knowledge. 
Your brain will be able to build a complete picture of knowledge since everything is interconnected.

### 8. Set deadlines

You should be careful with that. Do not put too much pressure on yourself. 
It is better slowly go forward rather than rush and stop abruptly. 
You can ask someone you trust to help you with controlling and setting deadlines.

### 9. Only dumb devices near bed

### 10. Fight with procrastination

1) It's perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session. 
   It's how you handle those feelings that matters. Say to yourself smth like 
   "**Once you get going, you'll feel better about it**".
2) **Concentrate on the process** (studying, reading), not on the product (homework done, complex test solved). 
   And relax into the flow of the work.
3) Use **pomodoro technique** (25 minutes sessions with 5 minutes breaks). Put forth your best effort for a short period.
4) **Develop a plan**. Plan your quiting time as well! **Keep a planner journal**. If you don't write your tasks down, they can lurk 
at the edge of the four or so slots in your working memory, taking up valuable mental real estate.

Procrastination includes:
- The cue. To fix you should work on reactions at the cue.
- The routine. To fix you should develop a plan. It may not work properly at first but just keep at it. 
  Savor victories when your plan works.
- The reward. To fix you should reward yourself better after studying/working time. 
  **Trust your new system and when it comes to relax do it without feeling guilty or worry**.
- The belief. To fix you can develop a new community that enjoys studying/working.

### 11. Spaced repetition

### 12. Verbally stated goals

Clarity of your desires, goals, and vision. 

### 13. Single tasking

Focus is knowing exactly what you want to be, have, and do. Concentration is persevering, without diversion or distraction, 
in a straight line toward accomplishing the things that can make a real difference in your life.

### 14. Deep work blocks based on your body's rhythm

### 15. 80/20s at every level

20 percent of your activities will account for 80 percent of your results.
Two out of ten items, on any general to-do list, will turn out to be worth more than the other eight items put together.
The sad fact is that most people procrastinate on the top 10 or 20 percent of items that are the most valuable and important,
and busy themselves instead with the least important 80 percent that contribute very little to their success.
Ask yourself: If you could only accomplish one of the goals on that list today, which one goal would have the greatest positive impact on your life?
Then pick the second most important goal. **Eat the biggest frog first**. 
Before you begin work, always ask yourself, ‚Äú**Is this task in the top 20 percent of my activities** or in the bottom 80 percent?‚Äù

### 16. Practice/Repeating makes permanent

Repeating/Practicing something you build a strong neural network in your brain to solve this next time. 
Even for bad habits/patterns.

### 17. What have been done / Control assessment

Write a blog post or conduct a control assessment of new skills you've got after curriculum.
The best way to learn is not rereading the book but trying to **recall from the material you've just read**. 
The "recall" is a very powerful tool! You can even try to recall outside after learning.

### 18. Chunking

1) Eliminate distracting
2) Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk. 
   Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns
3) Understand the context. Practice. Not just how but also when to use or not to use. 
   You should mix "top down learning" (big picture) with "bottom up learning" (chunking).
   Try to do rapid picture/heading walk through next chapter of the book you are studying. It'll help
   you to see connections between ideas at the beginning.

### 19. Deliberate practice

Focus on the more difficult material instead of repeat easy one thousand times.

### 20. Interleaving between subjects

Start building flexibility and creativity. It's where you leave the world of practice and repetition, 
and begin thinking more independently. For my purposes, I should interleave Data Science, Brain Sciences (math, biology, etc), and English.

### 21. Eat the biggest frog first

### 22. Metaphors and visualisation for learning



## Believes

### 1. Fundamental drive: the joy of learning, maximizing usefulness

Studying fun. Einstein's curiosity, my own curiosity.
Studying is said to be work. With this attitude it will be hell to study. Because there‚Äôs always more to learn.
Think about studying as a game. But suppose, you have the idea studying is the process of going 
through one topic and then to the next. Connecting different things like a game. 
You learn one thing, you use it to learn something else, you get stuck, you get over it, you learn another thing. 
And you make a dance out of it.

But on the other side embrace the suck. Studying sucks. You learn one thing and forget it the next day.
After studying something for a year you realise how much more there is to learn.

### 2. Don't go around in circles and don't go blind

The huge mistake is doing the same things and wait for another results.

### 3. Social accountability

### 4. Time * intensity of focus = progress

### 5. Context switching costs

### 6. Goal factoring

### 7. Zero distractions

### 8. Dream big dreams

### 9. Anxious affects brain in negative way

When you are stressed your attentional octopus begins to lose the ability to make some connections.

### 10. Illusions of competence

Merely glancing at the solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of 
the most common illusions of competence in learning. Try to do fewer highlights and underlying.


## Anti-patterns

1. Purely project-based learning
2. Learning styles
3. Digital hoarding
4. 1+ year curriculum plans
5. Willpower
6. Announcing goals (is dangerously satisfying)
