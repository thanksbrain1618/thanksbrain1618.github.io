## Blogging tips
- **Write a vision statement**. Your first sentence must be indelible (less than 140 characters),
  It is a sentence you will come back to a few times throughout the post;
- **Provide preview that illustrates what is at stake and sets the scaffolding  for your thesis**;
- **Use 'inverted pyramid'**:
    1. Put the essential information, such as a conclusion, in the first paragraph;
    2. Follow with paragraphs of increasing detail;
    3. End with relevant links to further information on the topic.
- Write about **one thousand words**;
- **Each subsection needs to transition the reader from one idea to the next**.
